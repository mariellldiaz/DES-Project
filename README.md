# DES-Project
Optimizing ICU Workflows Through DEVS and Petri Nets Integration

## Project Overview
This project models and simulates ICU (Intensive Care Unit) workflow by integrating Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) framework and Petri Nets.
The goal is to optimize patient admission, treatment, and discharge processes while managing limited resources (bed & nurses).
The simulation helps idenify hinders and improve resource allocation to enhance patient care outcomes.

## Key Features
**DEVS Framework**: dynamic event-driven adaptability for real-time adjustments in ICU workflows.

**Petri Nets**: models concurrency, resource constraints, and complex workflows to visualize patient flow and resource usage.

**Resource Management**: simulates ICU beds and nurses to identify inefficiencies and optimize patient care processes.

**Simulation**: Uses the 'SimPy' library for discrete-event simulation of ICU operations.
